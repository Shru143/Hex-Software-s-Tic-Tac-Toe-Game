# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built using Python and the Tkinter library. The game allows you (the player) to compete against the computer in a classic 3x3 grid format.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: The game interface is created using Tkinter with clickable buttons representing the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid.
- **Player vs. Computer**: The player is represented by 'X' and the computer by 'O'.
- **Winner Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or when the game ends in a tie.
- **Highlighted Winning Combination**: When a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted in green.
- **Game Over Pop-up**: The game displays a pop-up message announcing the winner or a tie.

## How to Play

1. The player (represented by 'X') starts the game.
2. Click on any empty cell to make your move.
3. The computer (represented by 'O') will automatically make its move after yours.
4. The game alternates turns until one player wins or the board is full.
5. When a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted, and a pop-up message will show the result.
6. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
